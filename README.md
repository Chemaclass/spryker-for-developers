# Basic characteristics of Spryker Development
Let's start off with some development principles that Spryker is based on, an why you might like working with it.
* Spryker`s entire architecture is built upon the best practices and well-known design principles [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it), [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) & [Factory method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern);
* Spryker has multiple levels of code reviews that are integrated into the development process:   
  * Developer code review      
  * Technical lead code review       
  * Application architect code review
* Besides the above human reviews, Spryker uses various tools for monitoring the quality of the codebase and performance of the product in general: [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/), [PHPMD](https://phpmd.org/), [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/), [Codeception](https://codeception.com/);
* We like to say that we are positive perfectionists, and work only with clean and high-quality code. But you don't need to take that from us: Check our increadible code quality rating on [Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/spryker/spryker-core/?branch=master) [![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/spryker/spryker-core/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/spryker/spryker-core/?branch=master). * Our code is open and accessible for everyone to see. Our code is **not** released under an open source license, but all code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/spryker), there are no parts hidden or encoded.
