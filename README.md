# Spryker for Developers
Here I'm creating an overview of why Spryker is a great platform to learn for developers. And if you're just like me, you don't want empty claims: you want the facts. So here we go :)

## Some basic characteristics of Spryker Development
* Spryker`s entire architecture is built upon the best practices and well-known design principles [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID), [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it), [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) & [Factory method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern);
* Spryker uses various tools for monitoring the quality of the codebase and performance of the product in general: PHPStan, PHPMD, Psalm, Scrutinizer, Codeception;
* Spryker has multiple levels of code reviews that are integrated into the development process:   
  * Developer code review      
  * Technical lead code review       
  * Application architect code review
* We like to say that we are positive perfectionists, and work only with clean and high-quality code. But you don't need to take that from us: Check our increadible code quality rating on [Scrutinizer](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/spryker/spryker-core/?branch=master) [![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/spryker/spryker-core/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/spryker/spryker-core/?branch=master):
